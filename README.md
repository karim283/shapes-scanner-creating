This project is a web-based tool designed for users to upload images, trace black lines within the images, and customize shape designs in an animated blob style. The tool allows users to see a preview of black-line shapes extracted from uploaded images and customize animated blobs by selecting shape types, colors, and animation settings.

How It Works
Technologies Used
HTML5 for structuring the web page content.
CSS3 for styling and animation effects.
JavaScript for interactivity and DOM manipulation, without any external libraries.
File Structure
The project consists of the following files:

index.html: The main HTML file with shape description, buttons, and links.
style.css: Styles for index.html, providing a modern look with animations.
blob.html: The shape blob creation HTML page.
create.css: Styles for blob.html.
script.js: JavaScript functions for customizing the shape blob.
script2.js: JavaScript functions for the image upload, trace, and preview functionality.
HTML Structure
index.html
The index.html file is the introductory page, offering users buttons to either "scan design" or "create design" by redirecting to respective pages (scan.html and start.html). It consists of:

Head Section: Specifies metadata, styles, and icon.
Body Section:
Header (h1): The main title of the page.
Subheader (h4): Descriptive paragraph about the toolâ€™s purpose.
Buttons: Links to other pages using <a> tags to navigate to either scan.html or start.html.
blob.html
blob.html is for the blob shape customization tool and consists of:

Shape Selection: Radio buttons to select either "Circle" or "Square."
Color Selection: Options for Blue, Red, or Green colors.
Animation Controls: Sliders for adjusting amplitude and frequency of the blob animation.
Canvas: A canvas element for rendering animated shapes.
scan.html
This page provides the user interface for the image upload, trace, and preview functionality:

Image Upload Section: Contains an input field for file uploads.
Canvas: Used to show the uploaded image and the traced black lines.
CSS Styling
style.css (for index.html)
Defines background styling, text formatting, and button styling:

Background Image & Overlay: A background image fills the viewport, with an overlay to darken it, making the content readable.
Keyframes Animation: @keyframes fadeIn animates the text headers to fade in, adding a smooth introductory effect.
Responsive Design: Uses media queries to adjust font size and layout for smaller screens.
create.css (for blob.html and scan.html)
Background and Text Styling: Maintains a dark background and white text for readability.
Upload and Preview Section: The upload and preview classes style the two main content boxes for image upload and canvas display.
Canvas Settings: Adds box shadows for the canvas elements and sets a transparent background.
JavaScript Functionality
script.js (for Shape Blob Customization in blob.html)
This script allows users to customize and animate a blob shape:

HTML Elements:

Grabs elements such as the canvas, shape, and color forms, as well as sliders for controlling animation amplitude and frequency.
Event Listeners:

shapeForm.addEventListener("change", ...): Updates the shape based on the selected radio button.
colorForm.addEventListener("change", ...): Updates the color.
amplitudeSlider.addEventListener("input", ...) & frequencySlider.addEventListener("input", ...): Adjust animation values for amplitude and frequency.
Animation Function (animateBlob):

Draws either a circle or square that varies over time using sinusoidal functions to create a "blob" effect.
Uses ctx.shadowColor to add a shadow, making the blob appear more three-dimensional and dynamic.
Calls requestAnimationFrame(animateBlob) to continuously animate and update the shape.
script2.js (for Image Upload, Trace, and Preview in scan.html)
Handles image uploads, tracing, and displaying black lines only:

File Input Handling:

Uses the change event to detect file uploads, displaying the uploaded image on uploadCanvas.
If an image file is loaded, its URL is used as the source for the img element to display it on the canvas.
Trace Black Lines (traceBlackLines function):

Image Data Processing: Retrieves pixel data from uploadCanvas and scans each pixel.
Black Pixel Detection: Checks if each pixel is black (RGB values close to 0) and draws a black dot on the previewCanvas if it is.
This effectively outlines and reproduces only the black lines from the uploaded image on the preview canvas.
How It Works
Homepage (index.html): Presents the main introduction and navigation options.
Blob Shape Customization:
Users select shape and color, then adjust animation settings.
JavaScript dynamically changes the shape appearance and re-renders the animation on the canvas.
Image Upload and Trace:
When an image is uploaded, the traceBlackLines function processes the image to identify black lines only.
The traced black lines are rendered on the preview canvas, providing a simplified, black-only representation of the uploaded image.
